# Gyro_Arm
Accelerometer controlled robotic arm (of sorts) 

This was a personal project of sorts that (contrary to the title) uses an accelerometer to control the movement of a robotic arm. 
The materials used for this particular script are as follows

- (2) x Arduino Uno
- (1) x 'Mini Servo' from SEEED Studio 'Grove - Starter Kit for Arduino'
- (1) x Futaba S3003 servo 
- (1) x ADXL335 Accelerometer 
- Breadboards/wires/rubber bands/random knex pieces 

I'll try to upload a video to youtube when I have time
